# üèà NFL Prospect API

## Description
This project is a full-stack application that provides information about NFL prospects and drafted players. It consists of a React TypeScript frontend and a Flask (Python) backend, leveraging the NFL v5 Sportradar US API to fetch player data.

The application allows users to input a player's name and the year they were either drafted or considered an NFL prospect. It then retrieves and displays key information about the player, including:

- Position
- Height
- Weight
- Year
- Place of birth
- University
- Conference

This tool can be particularly useful for sports analysts, fantasy football enthusiasts, or anyone interested in NFL player statistics and background information.
