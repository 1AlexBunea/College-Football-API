NFL Prospect API which has a front end that was developed through React JS. The front end takes in two parameters, a player's name and the year that they were either drafted or that they were an NFL prospect. The program then sends a request to the local server, where the backend, programmed in Python, takes in the name and the year as a parameter and then accesses the NFL v5 Sportradar US API. The backend returns the position, height, weight,  year, place of birth, University, and conference, where the data is then displayed on the front end, React JS page.
